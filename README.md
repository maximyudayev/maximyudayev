# Hi, I’m Maxim 👋

**PhD Researcher | Distributed Realtime Systems Architect | Edge AI and HPC Engineer | Electronics Engineer**

I leverage systems thinking to conceptualize and develop efficient distributed realtime sensing and AI processing systems for novel HealthTech applications at the Edge and on HPC (high-performance computing).

My work emphasizes efficiency, reliability, and downstream impact, at the intersection of software and hardware, and focuses on delivering practical solutions to complex R&D challenges.
